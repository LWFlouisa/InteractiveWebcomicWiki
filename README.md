# InteractiveWebcomicWiki
This will be my wiki page for Interactive Webcomics, a form of interactive fiction similar to visual novels, but geared around western Indie Comics. These are interactive fictions broken down panel per panel, and have similar separations between kinetic and branching as OVNs do.
